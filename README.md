# JAI

Jai - Open AI API Java ClientIntroducing Jai - a simple and efficient Java client powered by Open AI. We developed 
this client to provide a lightweight and uncomplicated option for accessing the Open AI API. With Jai, you can 
effortlessly send chat requests and receive accurate responses without unnecessary features.

# Goals

Goals for JAI include providing a simple and easy-to-use Java client for the Open AI API, without any unnecessary
extras dependencies that could make it more challenging to use. And with an as little learning curve as possible so 
no fancy new framework to learn. Additionally, JAI aims to be lightweight and fast, allowing developers to quickly 
and easily integrate it into their projects.

Here is a list of goals for this project

- minimal dependencies
- no surprises
    - Works sync or async but does not force developers either way
    - It does not force you to learn to use a new framework
    - It should work well in any Java environment
    - Easy to use idiomatic
- light-weight and small
- easy to learn

ðŸ‘‰ This is a new project and is still a work in progress.

</aside>

JAI is a new project that is still a work in progress. This means that the project is in its early stages of development 
and may not have all the features the creators are planning to implement. It also implies that there could be some bugs 
or issues that the developers are still working on fixing. Nonetheless, JAI has clear goals and objectives for the 
project, which include providing a simple and easy-to-use Java client for the Open AI API with as little learning 
curve as possible. We also aim to make it lightweight and fast, allowing developers to quickly and easily integrate
it into their projects.

JAI aims to be as straightforward as possible, with no surprises and no esoteric framework to learn. It is a minimalist 
Java library that is easy to use and requires no extra dependencies other than the JDK itself. This makes it simple to 
integrate into your projects without worrying about complex configurations or additional libraries.

### Maven

JAI only depends on JParse for JSON parsing, with no other dependencies except the JVM itself.

Here are instructions on how to include your project with Maven.

```xml
<!-- See for latest version https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/cloudurable/jparse -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.cloudurable</groupId>
    <artifactId>jai</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle

Here are instructions on how to include your project with Gradle.

```java
//See for latest version  https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/cloudurable/jai
implementation group: 'com.cloudurable', name: 'jai', version: '1.0.0'
```

# What is JAI?

JAI simplifies the use of Open AI API in Java. It has no unnecessary dependencies and can be easily integrated into 
projects using Maven or Gradle. With JAI, you can make chat requests synchronously or asynchronously.

## Using JAI

### Create the client

```java
// Create the client
final OpenAIClient client = OpenAIClient.builder().setApiKey(System.getenv("OPEN_AI_KEY")).build();
```

### Chat

### Create a chat request

```java
        // Create the chat request
        final ChatRequest chatRequest = ChatRequest.builder().setModel("gpt-3.5-turbo")
                .addMessage(Message.builder().setContent("What is AI?").setRole(Role.USER).build())
                .build();
```

### Invoke the client async for chat

```java
        // Call Open AI API with chat message
client.chatAsync(chatRequest).thenAccept(response -> {
      response.getResponse().ifPresent(chatResponse -> 
                    chatResponse.getChoices().forEach(System.out::println));
      response.getException().ifPresent(Throwable::printStackTrace);
      response.getStatusMessage().ifPresent(error -> 
                  System.out.printf("status message %s %d \n", error, 
                           response.getStatusCode().orElse(0)));
});
```

### Invoke the client synchronously for chat

```java
// Call Open AI API with chat message
final ClientResponse<ChatRequest, ChatResponse> response = 
                                                      client.chat(chatRequest);

response.getResponse().ifPresent(
				chatResponse -> chatResponse.getChoices().forEach(System.out::println));
response.getException().ifPresent(Throwable::printStackTrace);
response.getStatusMessage().ifPresent(
		error -> 
			System.out.printf("status message %s %d \\n", error, 
                                      response.getStatusCode().orElse(0)))

```

### Next steps

1. Add support for completions
2. Add support for edits
3. Add support for updates
4. Add support for file uploads
5. Add support for tunings
6. Add support for text to audio
7. Add support for audio to text
8. Create some examples with chat streaming
9. Create some examples with chat functions and function callbacks

We are at the start of this journey.
